# Bridge index of thirteen-crossing knots

KnotInfo (version 2026.10.5) lists the bridge index of 536 prime knots with 13 crossings as
`[3,4]`: it is known to be 3 or 4, and the exact value is not known.

**Result.** 243 of these knots have bridge index 4 and meridional rank 4, so the meridional
rank conjecture of Cappell and Shaneson holds for them (Kirby's problem list, Problem 1.11).
The list is in [`paper/bridge13.pdf`](paper/bridge13.pdf), Appendix A, and in
[`data/certificates.json`](data/certificates.json). The other 293 knots, listed in
[`data/still_open.json`](data/still_open.json), stay open.

| group | image of a meridian | knots |
|---|---|---|
| Sp(4, F₃) | transvection | 67 |
| Sp(4, F₅) | transvection | 161 |
| O(4, F₅) | reflection | 15 |

## Second result: the nonorientable four-genus

The folder [`crosscap4d/`](crosscap4d/) settles the smooth nonorientable four-genus γ₄ of
2,093 of the 3,525 knots with 11 to 13 crossings that KnotInfo leaves open (465 at γ₄ = 1,
1,628 at γ₄ = 2) and lowers the upper bound of 575 more, each by one pinch move checked in
Regina. The paper is [`crosscap4d/paper/crosscap4d.pdf`](crosscap4d/paper/crosscap4d.pdf).

## The proof

Write μ(K) for the meridional rank and b(K) for the bridge index; always μ(K) ≤ b(K).

- **Upper bound.** The KnotInfo diagram of each knot has Wirtinger number 4. By Blair,
  Kjuchukova, Velazquez and Villanueva, the bridge index is at most the Wirtinger number of
  any diagram, so b(K) ≤ 4.
- **Lower bound.** Each certificate is a homomorphism ρ from the knot group to GL(4, F_q)
  that sends the meridian to a pseudo-reflection: a matrix fixing a hyperplane.
  - Each meridian is sent to a pseudo-reflection, and the hyperplanes they fix meet only
    in 0, so no nonzero vector is fixed by the whole image.
  - If k meridians generated the group, their images would fix the intersection of k
    hyperplanes. That intersection is nonzero when k ≤ 3, so μ(K) ≥ 4.

The pseudo-reflections used are transvections x ↦ x + ω(x,v)v of a symplectic form, or
reflections of a quadratic form. Earlier lower bounds came from Coxeter quotients, where
meridians go to order-2 reflections. The order-3 and order-5 transvections settle most of
these knots.

## Checking it

```
python3 verify/verify.py              # standard library only
pip install database_knotinfo
python3 verify/verify.py --knotinfo   # also compares PD codes and [3,4] entries with KnotInfo
```

For every knot the verifier checks each of the following:

- the matrices are constant along arcs;
- the Wirtinger relation holds at every crossing;
- each arc matrix minus the identity has rank 1;
- the stacked matrices minus the identity have rank 4;
- the four seed arcs color the whole diagram by the Wirtinger coloring moves.

All 243 pass in a few seconds. The verifier rejects four kinds of corrupted certificate:

- a changed matrix entry;
- seeds on three arcs;
- one crossing with its overstrand reversed;
- identity matrices.

## Layout

- `paper/`: the paper `bridge13.tex` and its PDF (also in `paper1/`, with the TeX sources
  zipped in `paper2/`). `make_tables.py` writes `generated.tex` from the data.
- `data/certificates.json`: for each knot, the KnotInfo PD code, the prime q, one 4×4 matrix
  per edge, and four seed edges.
- `data/still_open.json`: the 293 knots with entry `[3,4]` that remain open.
- `verify/verify.py`: the verifier.
- `search/`: the programs that found the certificates (`symp.py`, `run_sp2.py`, `generic.py`
  for searches over colorings; `gram.py`, `ogram.py`, `glsearch.py`, `gram_gf.py` for searches
  over Gram matrices of the seeds; `w3.py` for 3-bridge diagrams; `alexq.py`, `alexq_exact.py` for Alexander-quandle colourings and
  `braid3.py` for closed 3-braids, both of which settle none of the open knots). `make_certificates.py`
  writes `data/certificates.json` from their output. These programs need numpy, SnapPy and
  database_knotinfo, and are run from `search/`; the proof does not depend on them.
- `CITATION.cff` and `.zenodo.json`: how to cite this repository, and the metadata of its Zenodo
  archive. `.github/workflows/release.yml`, run by hand, checks every certificate against KnotInfo
  and publishes a release with the paper and a zip of the repository; Zenodo archives it.
